For this assignment, I scrapped data for the product **Panera Bread Broccoli Cheddar Soup 16 oz**  from Amazon.com and Walmart.com

## Panera_Rating
It is a Tableau dashboard with 3 graphs analyzing the star reviews given by customers.

### The first graph :
It provides a count and percentage of different star ratings 

## The second graph ( Positive feedback):
It provides a count of stars for the feedbacks categorized as "positive" on Amazon.com. The x- axis shows the main words used in each comment. 

## The third graph ( Critical feedback):
It provides a count of stars for the feedbacks categorized as "critical " on Amazon.com. The x- axis shows the main words used in each comment. 

## Panera_Words
It provides analysis of the words used in comment both in the body of the comment as well as the title.
